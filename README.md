### Adnormal-Action-Detection-In-Video 
The whole project was performed when we was doing our Project 3 subject about machine learning.

All the source and dataset(video) for this project is stored at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KwTTyPKs3pmM8NxB2qqTs_vZFf-q_z02?usp=sharing). It contains many videos,
referrence document and report that are shared to our professor who instructs us in this semester.
We also thanks to GitHub user named Poornav for [the project](https://github.com/Poornav/Unusual-Human-Activity-Detection.git) he had done, we use that as a important referrence resource for learning and coding practices
